# 240sxDataLogger-repo
*Combines a wide range of libraries to create a data logger for track car.*

The end goal is to create a device that logs acceleration forces, heading direction, GPS location, and vehicle information from a Nissan 240sx to a SD card in a format readable by RaceRender software. 

This was originally programmed with the Arduino IDE but I moved over to Atmel Studio 7.0 when it started to get messy. I believe all the libraries are added to this repository so if you wanted, you could just download it and setup your Arduino the way I have to get it to work.

## Hardware Used
- Venus838FLPx GPS Module
- SparkFun OpenLog
- AdaFruit 10DOF Sensors
- Nissan Consult communication hardware (I built)

## Project Status
Date: 1/1/2018 -> **Incomplete**
